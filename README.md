## Hey ðŸ‘‹ <br>

Iâ€™ve been a FiveM enthusiast since 2019, diving into the world of modding, scripting, and all things server-related. <br>
Before that, I spent 4 years playing RP on alt:V and RageMP, which gave me a solid understanding of how roleplay environments work. <br>
Now, I focus on bringing that experience and RP knowledge into my scripts, aiming to make them as immersive and functional as possible. <br>
Always experimenting with new ideas, learning, and looking for ways to improve. <br>
