## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been a FiveM enthusiast since 2019, diving into the world of modding, scripting, and all things server-related.
Before that, I spent 4 years playing RP on alt:V and RageMP, which gave me a solid understanding of how roleplay environments work.
Now, I focus on bringing that experience and RP knowledge into my scripts, aiming to make them as immersive and functional as possible.
Always experimenting with new ideas, learning, and looking for ways to improve.
